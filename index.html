        <P class="f-500">Demand on market :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Everyone Wants to Stabilize Their Business, and Advertising is Key!<br/>
            One of the best ways to advertise is through hoardings and banners. Businesses use them to promote 
            their products and services, which helps increase sales.   <br/>         
            If your terrace has enough space, you can rent it out for hoardings and banners. This is an easy way for 
            you to earn money while helping others advertise their business!</p>

        <P class="f-500">Process :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Rent Out Your Terrace for Hoardings and Banners: A Simple Way to Earn! <br/>
            Space Requirement: Your terrace should have at least 10 feet by 10 feet of space for hoardings or banners.<br/>
            1: Many builders or advertising agencies will set up the hoardings for you, bring in clients, and take a commission. <br/>
            2: If you want to set it up yourself, 100% of the earnings are yours.<br/>
            <strong>Setup Costs: ₹30,000 to ₹40,000.</strong><br/>
            <strong>Monthly Income: ₹25,000 to ₹50,000 after setup.</strong><br/>

            all the setup, and you won’t need to invest any money.<br/>

        <P class="f-500">Drawbacks :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Renting out your terrace for hoardings and banners can be a profitable venture, but like any 
            business, it comes with its own set of challenges. One of the primary concerns is during <strong>cyclone season.</strong> 
            In such times, it's important to take extra precautions. For hoardings and banners, you should remove them 
            before the cyclone to avoid damage or any safety hazards. However, if you have a tower installed, there 
            are no such issues, as towers are designed to withstand extreme weather conditions. By being proactive 
            and planning ahead, you can continue earning from your terrace while minimizing risks during adverse 
            weather.</p>

        <P class="f-500">Conclusion :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Renting out your terrace for hoardings and banners is a highly profitable business with no 
            initial investment. It not only provides a steady side income but also offers extra benefits with minimal 
            maintenance. Getting clients is easy, as companies and agencies will connect with you directly, requiring 
            no extra effort on your part. Once set up, it becomes a permanent source of income that continues without 
            any end, making it a great long-term business opportunity.</p>

        <h3> <i class="bi bi-bookmark-star-fill me-3"></i>Incense stick ( अगर्बत्ती ) Cost : ₹50,000 - ₹1,00,000 </h3>
        <p>Incense stick making is a popular medium-scale business due to its high returns with minimal effort. 
            With an investment of <strong>₹50,000 to ₹80,000</strong>, this business offers a great profit margin. The best part 
            is that it requires <strong>no additional labor costs</strong>—one person can manage everything, from production and 
            packaging to selling. Many companies provide machines for incense stick production and also buy back 
            the finished product, eliminating the stress of finding buyers. This ensures a good profit range 
            without any extra expenses!</p>       
        <P class="f-500">Demand on market :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Day by day, human needs are evolving, and the demand for incense sticks is steadily increasing. 
            While they are traditionally used for puja and religious rituals, incense sticks are now widely used 
            for mosquito repellent, meditation, and enhancing home ambiance. This growing demand across various 
            sectors ensures a strong market. Additionally, local markets often have low competition, and the 
            buy-back feature offered by many companies makes it easier to produce and sell products with a good 
            profit margin.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Where to sell :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">The selling process for incense sticks is simple and efficient, especially with the buy-back feature. 
            By purchasing the machine, you can sell the product back to the company, though this typically offers 
            lower profit margins. For higher profits, consider selling directly in the local market and retail shops. 
            Retailers can purchase your product at a slightly lower price and sell it to customers at market rates, 
            ensuring consistent demand and turning them into your regular customers. 
            Keep in mind that product quality should never be compromised, as this can negatively impact your sales.</p>
        <P class="f-500"> Margin Calculation :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Machine Cost: <strong>₹60,000 - ₹80,000</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Raw Material Cost: (charcol) <strong>₹25 - ₹35 per kg</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Raw Material: (stick bundle) <strong>₹100 - ₹120 (3500 pieces)</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Labor Cost: <strong>₹400 (Per Day)</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Production Rate: <strong>1 kg produces 1000 to 1200 incense sticks</strong> </p>
        <p class="m-1ch">1 kg produces ~ 30 packets</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">1 box contains 12 packets, so <strong>1 kg produces 2.5 boxes</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">If You Produce 10 kg per Day</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Total Cost: <strong>₹25 - ₹35 (per kg) + ₹30 - ₹40 (sticks) + ₹10 (electricity) + ₹40 (labor) + ₹35 (packing) = ₹145 - ₹150 for 2.5 boxes</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Selling Price per Box: <strong>₹100 - ₹10 (coupon) = ₹90. For 2.5 boxes, ₹90 * 2.5 = ₹225</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Profit Margin: <strong>₹70 - ₹75 (per kg). For 10 kg, ₹75 * 10 = ₹750</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">A single person can produce 15 kg per day (machine is automated, and one person can guide the process)</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Daily Earnings: <strong style="color: red;">₹1000 - ₹1100</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Monthly Earnings <strong>(20 days): ₹20,000 (after removing all extra costs)</strong></p>
        <p class="m-1ch">If a person works dedicatedly, they can produce 20 kg per day, increasing the profit margin.</p>
        <p class="m-1ch" style="color: red;"><strong>Note:</strong> Calculations may vary based on location and demand. Before proceeding, please verify with your local market to ensure accuracy and feasibility.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Drawbacks :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">While the incense stick business has many advantages, it also comes with a few challenges. 
            Competing with established brands can be tough, and some retail shops may initially hesitate to 
            accept your product. However, staying focused on sales and building trust with your quality will 
            eventually win them over. Remember, maintaining high product quality is essential for earning customer 
            loyalty and standing out in the market.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Prescription for Drawbacks :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">To overcome challenges in the incense stick business, always focus on delivering exceptional product quality. 
            Ensure the fragrance is long-lasting and pleasant, as this greatly impacts customer satisfaction. 
            Packaging also plays a crucial role in building trust—use strong, attractive, and high-quality packaging. 
            Remember the saying, <strong>'Jo dikhega, wohi bikega' (What looks appealing sells)</strong>. Avoid marketing your product 
            as cheap; instead, <strong>keep the pricing competitive with other brands to maintain value perception.
            For an added edge, include a scratch card inside the box as a special incentive for retailers.</strong> This small 
            gesture not only makes your product more appealing but also encourages repeat purchases, boosting your sales 
            effectively.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Conclusion :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">The incense stick business is a promising venture with low investment and high returns. By maintaining product 
            quality, leveraging market demand, and implementing effective marketing strategies, you can establish a 
            successful and sustainable business. With dedication and smart planning, this opportunity can bring significant 
            profits and long-term growth.</p>

            <P class="f-500">Demand on market :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Over the past decade, tea sellers have adapted their offerings based on customer demand and 
            hygiene standards: <br/>
            <strong>10 Years Ago</strong>: Tea was commonly served in reusable glass cups, costing around <strong>₹5 per cup</strong>. <br/>
            <strong>Rise of Paper Cups</strong>: As hygiene awareness grew, paper cups became the preferred choice for tea sellers,

        </p>

        <P class="f-500">Where to sell :-</P>

                <li><strong>College Campuses:</strong>

                    stall in a college area can sell up to 10,000 cups per day due to the high footfall and the 
                    preference for trendy and eco-friendly products among students.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Areas:</strong>
                    Busy market areas are another ideal spot, where tea is a staple for shoppers, vendors,

                    partnerships with office cafeterias and tea vendors.</li>

        <p>Cow farming is an <strong>old and traditional business</strong> that continues to be profitable, just like it has been for 
            generations. It offers multiple ways to generate income, primarily through selling milk and milk products. 
            While it may require additional labor to manage the cows and maintain the business, the profits are often 
            high, especially when <strong>milk and dairy products are sold at premium rates</strong>. With proper care and management, 
            cow farming can be a steady and rewarding source of income.</p>       
        <P class="f-500">Demand on market :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Cow farming has high demand in the market because milk is a basic necessity for everyone, 
            whether it's <strong>children, the elderly, or patients.</strong> Milk is consumed universally, making it a product that 
            always has a steady market. The great thing about this business is that <strong>location is not a constraint—you 
            can sell milk and milk products anywhere.</strong> Additionally, milk products like <strong>paneer, ghee, and chena</strong> are 
            also in high demand, and they can be sold at premium prices, further boosting your income. This makes cow 
            farming a highly profitable venture with diverse revenue streams.</p>

        <P class="f-500">Where to sell :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">The great thing about cow farming is that location is not a constraint—you can sell milk and 
            milk products anywhere. You have several options for selling:<br/>
            <strong>Directly selling milk to customers gives you a steady stream of income with minimal effort. However, 
            the profit margin on milk alone may be lower.</strong><br/>
            <strong>You can also sell milk products like paneer, ghee, and chena, which offer higher profit margins. </strong><br/>
            To maximize your earnings, you can sell these products directly to <strong>shops, hotels, or even dairy shops.</strong><br/>
            In many villages, there are <strong>milk booths</strong> where you can sell your milk, making it an easy way to distribute.
             However, selling milk products to shops or hotels can bring in more income due to the <strong>higher selling 
             price of these products.</strong></p>

        <p>In the previous chapter, we calculated the margin for two cows, which represents a smaller scale of farming. 
            However, in this chapter, we are scaling up the calculation to 30 or more cows. The principles remain the 
            same, but when scaling to a larger scale, such as having 15 times the number of cows (i.e., 30 cows), the 
            expenses and labor requirements will increase by 15 times as well. However, the profit will increase by 30 
            times, as the revenue generated from selling the milk and other products. This demonstrates how, 
            even at a medium scale, the margin can grow significantly as we scale up the operation.</p>

            which serve multiple purposes. These dung cakes are used as a fuel source for cooking and heating in rural 
            areas. Moreover, the cow dung is processed to generate biogas, which can be converted into electricity. 
            This approach not only provides a sustainable and eco-friendly solution but also increases the income by 
            25% compared to traditional farming practices. This integrated approach creates a user-friendly system that
