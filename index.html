        <h3 >1. Incense stick ( अगर्बत्ती ) Cost : ₹50,000 - ₹1,00,000 </h3>
        <p>Incense stick making is a popular medium-scale business due to its high returns with minimal effort. 
            With an investment of ₹50,000 to ₹80,000, this business offers a great profit margin. The best part 
            is that it requires no additional labor costs—one person can manage everything, from production and 
            packaging to selling. Many companies provide machines for incense stick production and also buy back 
            the finished product, eliminating the stress of finding buyers. This ensures a good profit range 
            without any extra expenses!</p>       
        <P class="f-500">Demand on market :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Day by day, human needs are evolving, and the demand for incense sticks is steadily increasing. 
            While they are traditionally used for puja and religious rituals, incense sticks are now widely used 
            for mosquito repellent, meditation, and enhancing home ambiance. This growing demand across various 
            sectors ensures a strong market. Additionally, local markets often have low competition, and the 
            buy-back feature offered by many companies makes it easier to produce and sell products with a good 
            profit margin.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Where to sell :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">The selling process for incense sticks is simple and efficient, especially with the buy-back feature. 
            By purchasing the machine, you can sell the product back to the company, though this typically offers 
            lower profit margins. For higher profits, consider selling directly in the local market and retail shops. 
            Retailers can purchase your product at a slightly lower price and sell it to customers at market rates, 
            ensuring consistent demand and turning them into your regular customers. 
            Keep in mind that product quality should never be compromised, as this can negatively impact your sales.</p>
        <P class="f-500"> Margin Calculation :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">Machine Cost: ₹60,000 - ₹80,000</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Raw Material Cost: ₹250 (per 10 kg, ₹25 per kg)</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Raw Material: ₹100 (1 stick bundle = 3500 pieces)</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Labor Cost: ₹400 (for 1 labor)</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Production Rate: 1 kg produces 1000 to 1200 incense sticks per day</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">1 kg produces ~30 packets</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">1 box contains 12 packets, so 1 kg produces 2.5 boxes</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Total Cost: ₹25 (per kg) + ₹40 (sticks) + ₹10 (electricity) + ₹40 (labor) + ₹35 (packing) = ₹150 for 2.5 boxes</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Selling Price per Box: ₹100 - ₹10 (coupon) = ₹90. For 2.5 boxes, ₹90 * 2.5 = ₹225</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Profit Margin: ₹75 (per kg). For 10 kg, ₹75 * 10 = ₹750</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">A single person can produce 15 kg per day (machine is automated, and one person can guide the process)</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Daily Earnings: ₹1000 - ₹1100</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">Monthly Earnings (20 days): ₹20,000 (after removing all extra costs)</p>
        <p class="m-1ch">If a person works dedicatedly, they can produce 20 kg per day, increasing the profit margin.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Drawbacks :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">While the incense stick business has many advantages, it also comes with a few challenges. 
            Competing with established brands can be tough, and some retail shops may initially hesitate to 
            accept your product. However, staying focused on sales and building trust with your quality will 
            eventually win them over. Remember, maintaining high product quality is essential for earning customer 
            loyalty and standing out in the market.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Prescription for Drawbacks :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">To overcome challenges in the incense stick business, always focus on delivering exceptional product quality. 
            Ensure the fragrance is long-lasting and pleasant, as this greatly impacts customer satisfaction. 
            Packaging also plays a crucial role in building trust—use strong, attractive, and high-quality packaging. 
            Remember the saying, <b>'Jo dikhega, wohi bikega' (What looks appealing sells)</b>. Avoid marketing your product 
            as cheap; instead, keep the pricing competitive with other brands to maintain value perception.
            For an added edge, include a scratch card inside the box as a special incentive for retailers. This small 
            gesture not only makes your product more appealing but also encourages repeat purchases, boosting your sales 
            effectively.</p>
        <P class="f-500">Conclusion :-</P>
        <p class="m-1ch">The incense stick business is a promising venture with low investment and high returns. By maintaining product 
            quality, leveraging market demand, and implementing effective marketing strategies, you can establish a 
            successful and sustainable business. With dedication and smart planning, this opportunity can bring significant 
            profits and long-term growth.</p>
